Financial Transaction Manager, track everything with tags!

*Moola* is made to be a multi-currency, client-server based, "taggable" transaction and budget tracker.

You can organise your accounts, tag you transactions with information about them and categorise them in as many ways as you can imagine.
For instance, if you go to the Cake shop and buy a birthday cake for â‚¬20, you can tag that transaction with:
* Birthday
* Junkfood
* Jane Doe

Then when you want to see how much you've spent across all birthdays, it's as easy as checking the total of the `birthday` tag, or filtering it with a date range, (for birthdays this year) or filtering with other tags (e.g. `Birthdays` for `Jane Doe` in the last five years).

All tags are hierarchical, so instead of just using `Birthday`, you can use `Celebration|Birthday`, which means when you look for celebrations later you can also pick up anniversaries, Christmas, or that time you did something awesome.

Obviously, this is a work-in-progress.
